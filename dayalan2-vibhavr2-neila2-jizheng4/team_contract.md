# Team Contract

## Communication
1. **Team Meetings** Our team will meet once a week every Monday from 1930-2030 PM using Zoom. The meeting time will be used to discuss further development directions, setting up goals, and resolving issues. Smaller debugging groups can be planned on need. Instead of having a designated note taker, each person will add his part into the dev log every week.

2. **Assistance** Each team member can be contacted through Discord group chat. Outside of emergencies or other commitments, we commit to responding to Discord messages within 24 hours.

3. **Respect** Every member of the group can present his ideas/goals to the project. Final decisions on the project will be made on consensus. We understand there might be compromises, and we will do our best to achieve agreements unanimously.

## Collaboration

1. **Work Distribution** A breakdown of tasks and a priority table will be drafted in the first week into the project. Each week, the top items on the table will be broke down if necessary and distributed to programming groups (to ensure collaboration and more flexible distribution of work). 

2. **Time Commitment** To ensure an equal distribution of work, each member is expected to independently work for an average of 3 hours per week on the project. If a deliverable ends up taking more time, the rest of the team should be pulled in to assist with the unforseen complication, with each member taking an equal share of the workload or programming in pairs. If a part is not forseen to be completed at the deadline, the member responsible for that part could notify other members in the Discord chat for help/redistribution.

   However if a team member is habitually not completing their tasks, the team would discuss at the team meeting if any abnormal situations have arised. If the member(s) have invalid reasons for not completing work, the team will consider alerting a staff member.

3. **Conflict Resolution** Conflicts will be addressed and attempted to resolve during regular team meetings. At the end of team meetings we hope to reach an agreement so that conflicts are minimized. Extreme conflicts within the team will be decided by a Chrome Dinosaur Game. The member with the highest score (lol) will decide who was right and who was wrong (Might makes right).
